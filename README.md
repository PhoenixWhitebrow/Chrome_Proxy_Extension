# Chrome_Proxy_Extension
A simplistic extension for Google Chrome allowing to set up proxy settings inside the browser.

I didn't like the lack of proxy settings in Google Chrome similar to those in Firefox - the only option was to use the system proxy, which is inconvenient for me for a number of reasons. 

There were many offers in the Chrome web store, but they either had a small number of ratings, or they were going out of support soon, or they collected usage data, or did not report anything about collecting data at all, which for me is an indicator that data collection may take place - not an option. 

So I decided to create my own extension, which will definitely not spy on me, especially since Chrome API allows you to manage proxy settings (why in the name of all that is holy, the developers could not make normal settings for users in the browser - I can't imagine). 

In general, what happened happened. It works, and for me that's the main thing. 
In the near future, I will add a field to disable proxying for certain sites.
